End-to-end recipe that PRODUCED A WORKING INSTALL (verified 2026-06-17: `C:\qlcplus\qlcplus.exe` launches standalone, opens "Q Light Controller Plus - New Workspace"). Current upstream QLC+ uses **CMake**, not qmake — the old `make install` flow in the repo's `how to` file is obsolete. Related: [[priority-system-rebuild]].

## Environment
- MSYS2 MinGW64 at `C:\msys64`. Toolchain re-verified from scratch **2026-06-22** on a new
  machine: gcc **16.1.0**, Qt 5.15.x, cmake **4.3.4**, ninja **1.13.2**. (Original 2026-06-17
  machine had gcc 14.1 / cmake 3.30 / ninja 1.12 — versions drift, the recipe still holds.)
- **Invoke the MinGW64 shell via the Bash tool (Git Bash), NOT PowerShell:**
  `MSYSTEM=MINGW64 /c/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe -lc '<cmd>'`.
  PowerShell's `&` operator STRIPS the embedded double-quotes when handing the string to
  bash.exe, so the repo path with a space (`GIT Repos`) breaks (`cd: .../GIT: No such file`).
  Git Bash preserves the single-quoted arg intact. To dodge nested-shell output mangling,
  redirect to a log (`> /tmp/x.log 2>&1`) and read the file.
- Repo MSYS path on this machine (quote the space in "GIT Repos"):
  `/c/Users/louma/OneDrive/Desktop/GIT Repos/qlcplus`
- `-Werror -Wextra -Wall` is ON (variables.cmake) → ANY compiler warning fails the build. New
  code must be warning-clean. Under **gcc 16** upstream code is stricter than gcc 14 — see the
  gcc-16 test note below.

## From-scratch machine setup (verified 2026-06-22 — full toolchain was absent)
1. Install MSYS2: `winget install --id MSYS2.MSYS2 -e --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements` → lands at `C:\msys64`.
2. Sync DBs then install the toolchain (large, ~mins — run backgrounded):
   `pacman -Sy --noconfirm` then
   `pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5-websockets unzip`
3. **Build deps the configure HARD-fails without** (these were silently present on the old box;
   missing `libusb-1.0.dll` aborts configure at `platforms/windows/CMakeLists.txt:15`):
   `pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb mingw-w64-x86_64-fftw mingw-w64-x86_64-libsndfile`
4. D2XX SDK + the `<QDebug>` source fix — see One-time setup below. (`libola` stays "not found"
   → the OLA plugin is just skipped; not needed.)

## One-time setup
1. MSYS2 packages: see "From-scratch machine setup" above for the full list (toolchain, qt5,
   cmake, ninja, qt5-websockets, unzip, **libusb, fftw, libsndfile**).
2. FTDI **D2XX SDK** for the `dmxusb` plugin (USER NEEDS dmxusb — uses a USB-DMX dongle). The plugin hardcodes `C:/projects/D2XXSDK`. Recipe (from .github/workflows/build.yml):
   ```
   mkdir -p /c/projects/D2XXSDK && cd /c/projects/D2XXSDK
   wget https://qlcplus.org/misc/CDM-v2.12.36.20-WHQL-Certified.zip -O cdm.zip
   unzip -o cdm.zip && cd amd64
   gendef.exe - ftd2xx64.dll > ftd2xx.def
   dlltool -k --input-def ftd2xx.def --dllname ftd2xx64.dll --output-lib libftd2xx.a
   ```
   Produces ftd2xx.h, amd64/libftd2xx.a, amd64/ftd2xx64.dll.
3. Source fix committed on `priority-rebuild` (commit 89c450132): added `#include <QDebug>` to `plugins/dmxusb/src/ftd2xx-interface.cpp` (gcc14/Qt5.15 error "incomplete type QDebug"). Build-env fix, NOT part of the priority feature.

## Build + install (repeat each iteration)
From repo root in the MinGW64 shell:
```
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build-mingw     # configure (once; default = Qt-Widgets UI / QLC+4. -Dqmlui=ON would build QML UI — NOT wanted)
ninja  -C build-mingw                   # build (app at build-mingw/main/qlcplus.exe)
ninja  -C build-mingw install           # install to C:\qlcplus
```
`ninja install` copies app + plugins + fixtures + libusb/audio DLLs + ftd2xx64.dll, but NOT the Qt runtime.
Since 2026-06-22 the install **also copies the fork's deploy tooling** into `C:\qlcplus`:
`start-qlcplus.bat`, `setup-new-pc.bat`, the bundled `win-acme\` (cert tool), and the canonical
show **`SaveFile\Main Project.qxw`** (which `start-qlcplus.bat` auto-loads from the `SaveFile\`
subfolder). This is a Windows-only `install()` block in the root `CMakeLists.txt` (just after the
translations install) that sources from `deploy/` (scripts + win-acme) and `SaveFile/` (the show).
So the deployment folder is self-contained straight out of install — no manual copy of the
scripts/win-acme/project anymore. (Bundle the Qt + OpenSSL runtime separately, below.)

### gcc-16 gotcha: upstream UI tests fail -Werror → build the app despite them (verified 2026-06-22)
Under gcc 16, upstream test code trips `-Werror=deprecated-enum-enum-conversion`
(e.g. `ui/test/assignhotkey/assignhotkey_test.cpp`: `Qt::Key_B | Qt::SHIFT`). Tests are part
of the default `all` target AND of `ninja install` (no `BUILD_TESTING` toggle exists — test
subdirs are added unconditionally), so a plain `ninja` / `ninja install` STOPS on the test and
never links the app. The app + all 11 plugins themselves compile clean. Workaround that needs
NO source edits — build everything buildable, then install the artifacts directly:
```
ninja -C build-mingw -k 0              # keep going past the ~1 failing test exe; builds qlcplus.exe + plugins
cmake --install build-mingw            # runs cmake_install.cmake directly (NO rebuild → skips the broken test); → C:\qlcplus
```
(`ninja -C build-mingw install` does NOT work here — it re-enters `all` and dies on the test.
`cmake --install` just copies already-built files.) If you ever need the tests, fix the
deprecation in the upstream test sources or drop `-Werror` for the `*_test` targets.

## Make C:\qlcplus double-clickable (one-time — already done; redo only if a new Qt module is pulled in)
The tool is named **`windeployqt-qt5`** in MSYS2 (plain `windeployqt` is not on PATH). It is
INSUFFICIENT alone: it copies the Qt5*.dll's then aborts (exit 1) on "libGLESv2.dll does not
exist" (this Qt uses desktop GL, not ANGLE) BEFORE copying transitive deps + the platform
plugin. All three steps needed:
1. `cd /c/qlcplus && windeployqt-qt5 --no-translations qlcplus.exe qlcplusui.dll qlcplusengine.dll qlcpluswebaccess.dll Plugins/osc.dll Plugins/artnet.dll Plugins/e131.dll Plugins/midiplugin.dll Plugins/dmxusb.dll`
2. Copy Qt plugin folders from `C:/msys64/mingw64/share/qt5/plugins`: `platforms` (qwindows.dll — MANDATORY) plus `styles imageformats iconengines printsupport audio mediaservice bearer generic`.
3. Copy the full non-Qt dependency closure via ldd, from `/c/qlcplus`:
   ```
   ldd qlcplus.exe *.dll Plugins/*.dll Plugins/Audio/*.dll platforms/*.dll printsupport/*.dll imageformats/*.dll iconengines/*.dll styles/*.dll audio/*.dll mediaservice/*.dll bearer/*.dll \
     | grep "=> /mingw64/bin" | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u | while read d; do cp -u "$d" /c/qlcplus/; done
   ```
   Pulls in ICU trio (libicudt75/libicuin75/libicuuc75), libpcre2-16-0, libharfbuzz, libfreetype, libglib-2.0-0, zlib1, image libs (png/jpeg/tiff/webp/brotli), Qt5PrintSupport.dll, mingw runtime (libgcc_s_seh-1/libstdc++-6/libwinpthread-1). Re-run the ldd line → "remaining /mingw64/bin deps" must be 0. ~60 DLLs total in C:\qlcplus.

## TLS web access (HTTPS/WSS) — extra runtime DLLs
The TLS feature (`--web-cert`/`--web-key`, see [[salesforce-qlcplus-integration]]) makes
QtNetwork load **OpenSSL at runtime**. These are NOT pulled by the normal closure (nothing
linked them before), so a standalone `C:\qlcplus` needs them copied explicitly or `https://`
silently fails (`QSslSocket::supportsSsl()`==false), while plain HTTP still works:
```
cp /mingw64/bin/libssl-3-x64.dll /mingw64/bin/libcrypto-3-x64.dll /c/qlcplus/
```
(Qt here is 5.15 → OpenSSL **3.x**: `libssl-3-x64.dll`, `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`.)
Verified 2026-06-19: clean-env `C:\qlcplus\qlcplus.exe -w --web-cert cert.pem --web-key key.pem`
serves HTTPS 200 + `wss://` TLSv1.3 (modules load from `C:\qlcplus`).

## The three qlcplus folders (don't confuse them)
- **`.../GIT Repos/qlcplus`** — the git repo / source. `deploy/` here (scripts + bundled
  `win-acme/`) is the SOURCE the install copies from.
- **`C:\qlcplus`** — the raw `ninja install` / `cmake --install` OUTPUT target. Gets the app,
  plugins, and (since 2026-06-22) the deploy tooling. NOT where the user runs the show from.
- **`C:\Users\louma\OneDrive\Desktop\qlcplus`** — the user's REAL, portable club deployment:
  full Qt+OpenSSL runtime, real `cert.pem`/`key.pem` (issued by win-acme for lights.mayansvip.com),
  `Main Project.qxw`, a configured `win-acme/` (Release/full self-contained, 42 MB), and the
  working `setup-new-pc.bat`/`start-qlcplus.bat`. This is the copy that travels to the venue.
  (`start-qlcplus.bat` is identical to the repo's; `setup-new-pc.bat` differs only by the
  bundled-vs-Downloads win-acme lookup — repo version is the cleaner one.)

## Re-populating C:\qlcplus's Qt runtime the easy way
If `C:\qlcplus` is missing the Qt bundle (e.g. dir was recreated — seen 2026-06-19: only 16
DLLs, no `Qt5*.dll`/`platforms`), the user keeps a known-good standalone copy at
`C:\qlcplusTHISONEGOESTOCLUBWITHOUTHTTP` (the HTTP-less club build). Fastest fix — copy its
runtime in WITHOUT clobbering a freshly-built TLS app:
```
cp -rn /c/qlcplusTHISONEGOESTOCLUBWITHOUTHTTP/. /c/qlcplus/   # -n preserves new exe/dlls
```
Then add the OpenSSL DLLs (above). `cp -n` keeps your just-installed qlcplus.exe /
qlcpluswebaccess.dll (newer) and only fills in the missing Qt5*/plugins/mingw-runtime DLLs.

## Full rebuild from source if the deploy/build folders are lost
Everything needed to reconstruct lives in this branch:
1. Source (tracked) → build per this file (CMake/Ninja).
2. `ninja -C build-mingw install` → C:\qlcplus, then bundle the Qt runtime (from the user's
   known-good copy or windeployqt) **+ the OpenSSL DLLs** (TLS section above).
3. Deploy tooling is tracked under **`deploy/`** (`start-qlcplus.bat`, `setup-new-pc.bat`, and the
   bundled **`win-acme/`** self-contained cert tool — the v2.2.9 x64 *trimmed* build, ~20 MB
   `wacs.exe`, needs no .NET on the target). The install step now copies all of it into
   `C:\qlcplus` automatically (root `CMakeLists.txt` Windows `install()` block). Full venue/move
   steps: repo-root **`DEPLOYMENT.md`**.
4. Web/WSS + Salesforce contract: repo-root **`SALESFORCE_QLCPLUS_INTEGRATION.md`** +
   [[salesforce-qlcplus-integration]].
Not in git by default (regenerated, never committed): the TLS `cert.pem`/`key.pem` (issued by
win-acme) and the bundled Qt/OpenSSL DLLs. `deploy/win-acme/` IS committed so it travels with the
build (it's a ~20 MB binary — large for git, but intentional so a fresh PC needs nothing extra).

## Dev iteration shortcut
After code changes, just `ninja -C build-mingw && ninja -C build-mingw install`. The bundled Qt runtime/plugins in C:\qlcplus persist, so no re-bundling needed (unless a new Qt module is introduced). Or run the exe straight from the MinGW64 shell (all DLLs/Qt plugins resolve from mingw64) — no bundling needed for quick dev runs.

## Verify a build is runnable (clean env, no mingw64 on PATH)
PowerShell: `Start-Process C:\qlcplus\qlcplus.exe -PassThru`; after ~8s check it's still running and `$p.MainWindowTitle` is "Q Light Controller Plus ...". (Don't trust "process alive" alone — a missing-DLL error dialog keeps the process alive too; check loaded modules / window title.)
